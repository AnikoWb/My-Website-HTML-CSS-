<h1> Hello
<img src="Aniko.jpg">		</h1>		


<p> 
	I’m <span class="aniko">Aniko </span> and this is my first ever website, <em>welcome! </em> I have a background in HR & Recruiting but I’ve always been interested in <strong> TECH </strong> and I love learning differenet coding languages. I’m still at the beginning of this journey into this whole new world but I truly enjoy every step of it and I’m excited to see what it can bring. 
</p>


<p> 
	<span class="aniko"> My profile </span> <Br>
	True to the motto <strong> “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” </strong> (Steve Jobs) - I am eager to learn and I am constantly striving for perfection. Setbacks never discourage me; instead, they push me to work even harder, allowing me to set higher standards for myself. After 6+ years of HR & Recruiting experience mainly in the Tech industry, I am ready to turn my interest and passion into my new career and step into the real world of tech as a developer.
</p>

<p> 
	I am a Junior Software Developer looking to turn my interest and passion into my career that I love and enjoy every day. I truly enjoy learning and have been learning different programming languages (HTML, CSS, SQL) for years in my free time as a self-learner. Currently, I am enrolled in  HyperionDev's highly competitive Software Engineering Bootcamp, backed by the Department for Education and co-certified by several Russell Group universities. In this course, I have had the opportunity to work on different projects and build programs using Python, JavaScript, SQL and databases, and Docker. Being a top-performer student in the Bootcamp with <strong> 100% grade achievement </strong> makes me confident that I can add value to any team from day one, and with my motivation, high attention to detail, and quick learning skills I would progress and develop quickly in a Junior Developer role.  
</p>

<p>
	I’m a result-driven individual, motivated by success and I believe that being a Software/Web Developer is a highly rewarding career. I have extensive experience in customer service, working with data and databases, and documentation, which gives me transferable skills in addition to my great problem-solving skills, analytical mindset and proactive and positive attitude. In the last 5+ years I have been working at quickly growing tech start-ups in a fast-paced environment that I really enjoyed and it also allowed me to prove that even under strong pressure I possess a strong ability to perform effectively in a timely manner to meet tight deadlines.
